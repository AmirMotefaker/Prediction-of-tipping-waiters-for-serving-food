Being well presented, keeping track of tables, and remembering orders requires focus and concentration. \n\n- Waiters and waitresses inform the kitchen and bar of customer’s choices, as well as of any special dietary needs or special requests.\n\n- Greet customers and build a positive customer experience from when they sit down until the bill is paid.\n\n- Waitstaff are responsible for front of house tasks like setting tables, removing dinnerware, replenishing utensils and refilling glasses.\n\n- Restaurant servers are also responsible for cleaning up tables and dining areas, as well as tidying up any spills.\n\n- Servers must process sales and bring the check to customers at appropriate times.\n\n- A server needs to be trustworthy as they determine total charges, issue the check, take payment, give the check and payment to the host or manager, and return a customer’s credit card, signature slip, and any change.\n\n- Servers must know all of a restaurant’s sanitation, safety, and alcohol policies. A health inspection could happen any day, and restaurant servers need to make sure they aren’t committing any violations.\n\n- Communication between servers to chefs and hosts on meal progression times is also key in keeping the restaurant running efficiently.\n\n[Reference](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/how-to-a-be-a-good-server/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Restaurant recorded data\n\n- The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. \n\n- The data recorded by the food server is as follows:\n\n    - total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes\n    - tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars\n    - sex: gender of the person paying the bill\n    - smoker: whether the person smoked or not\n    - day: day of the week\n    - time: lunch or dinner\n    - size: number of people on a table \n\n\n- So this is the data recorded by the restaurant. Based on this data, our task is to find the factors affecting waiter tips and train a machine learning model to predict the waiter’s tipping.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-03T17:43:25.618362Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-03T17:43:25.618868Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.779679Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-03T17:43:25.618826Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.7784Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/restaurant-recorded-data/tips.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.782288Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.782686Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.791388Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.782648Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.790225Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.793642Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.794537Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.807813Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.794487Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-03T17:43:26.806499Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Waiter Tips Analysis\n\n- Let’s have a look at the tips given to the waiters according to:\n\n    -
