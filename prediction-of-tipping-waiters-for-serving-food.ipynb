Being well presented, keeping track of tables, and remembering orders requires focus and concentration. \n\n- Waiters and waitresses inform the kitchen and bar of customer’s choices, as well as of any special dietary needs or special requests.\n\n- Greet customers and build a positive customer experience from when they sit down until the bill is paid.\n\n- Waitstaff are responsible for front of house tasks like setting tables, removing dinnerware, replenishing utensils and refilling glasses.\n\n- Restaurant servers are also responsible for cleaning up tables and dining areas, as well as tidying up any spills.\n\n- Servers must process sales and bring the check to customers at appropriate times.\n\n- A server needs to be trustworthy as they determine total charges, issue the check, take payment, give the check and payment to the host or manager, and return a customer’s credit card, signature slip, and any change.\n\n- Servers must know all of a restaurant’s sanitation, safety, and alcohol policies. A health inspection could happen any day, and restaurant servers need to make sure they aren’t committing any violations.\n\n- Communication between servers to chefs and hosts on meal progression times is also key in keeping the restaurant running efficiently.\n\n[Reference](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/how-to-a-be-a-good-server/)","metadata":{}}]}
