Being well presented, keeping track of tables, and remembering orders requires focus and concentration. \n\n- Waiters and waitresses inform the kitchen and bar of customer’s choices, as well as of any special dietary needs or special requests.\n\n- Greet customers and build a positive customer experience from when they sit down until the bill is paid.\n\n- Waitstaff are responsible for front of house tasks like setting tables, removing dinnerware, replenishing utensils and refilling glasses.\n\n- Restaurant servers are also responsible for cleaning up tables and dining areas, as well as tidying up any spills.\n\n- Servers must process sales and bring the check to customers at appropriate times.\n\n- A server needs to be trustworthy as they determine total charges, issue the check, take payment, give the check and payment to the host or manager, and return a customer’s credit card, signature slip, and any change.\n\n- Servers must know all of a restaurant’s sanitation, safety, and alcohol policies. A health inspection could happen any day, and restaurant servers need to make sure they aren’t committing any violations.\n\n- Communication between servers to chefs and hosts on meal progression times is also key in keeping the restaurant running efficiently.\n\n[Reference](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/how-to-a-be-a-good-server/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Restaurant recorded data\n\n- The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. \n\n- The data recorded by the food server is as follows:\n\n    - total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes\n    - tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars\n    - sex: gender of the person paying the bill\n    - smoker: whether the person smoked or not\n    - day: day of the week\n    - time: lunch or dinner\n    - size: number of people on a table \n\n\n- So this is the data recorded by the restaurant.
