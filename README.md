# 10 restaurant server responsibilities 
- Servers should know the menu well enough to help diners make an informed meal choice—and to upsell when possible.

- Restaurant servers should be well-organized. Being well presented, keeping track of tables, and remembering orders requires focus and concentration. 

- Waiters and waitresses inform the kitchen and bar of customer’s choices, as well as of any special dietary needs or special requests.

- Greet customers and build a positive customer experience from when they sit down until the bill is paid.

- Waitstaff are responsible for front of house tasks like setting tables, removing dinnerware, replenishing utensils and refilling glasses.

- Restaurant servers are also responsible for cleaning up tables and dining areas, as well as tidying up any spills.

- Servers must process sales and bring the check to customers at appropriate times.

- A server needs to be trustworthy as they determine total charges, issue the check, take payment, give the check and payment to the host or manager, and return a customer’s credit card, signature slip, and any change.

- Servers must know all of a restaurant’s sanitation, safety, and alcohol policies. A health inspection could happen any day, and restaurant servers need to make sure they aren’t committing any violations.

- Communication between servers to chefs and hosts on meal progression times is also key in keeping the restaurant running efficiently.
